Living abroad, I need to stay updated on exchange rates at all times, so I became interested in creating a program for this purpose.

# Currency Exchange Rate Fetcher

This is a simple Python script to fetch and display the latest exchange rates for a given base currency using the Free Currency API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the `requests` library using pip if you don't have it installed:

- pip install requests
